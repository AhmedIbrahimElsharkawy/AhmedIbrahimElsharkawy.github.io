I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)], working with **Professor SeungJun Kim** at the [Human-Centered Intelligent Systems (HCIS) Lab]. Concurrently, I serve as a postdoctoral researcher for the **DGIST InnoCORE Research Group**, focusing on Bio-Embodied Physical AI. Prior to my current position, I served as a **Research Assistant Professor** in the department of AI convergence at GIST for one year. I received my Ph.D. in Integrated Technology (specializing in **Intelligent Robotics**) from GIST in 2023. Before that, I earned my M.S. in **Mechatronics Engineering** from GIST in 2017. My research lies at the intersection of **Human Computer/Robot Interaction (HCI)**, **Extended Reality (XR)**, and **Physical AI**.
